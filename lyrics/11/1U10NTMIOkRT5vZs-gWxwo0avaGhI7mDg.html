<!-- Numb - BV2 F -->
<span class="info">INTRO 8 BARS</span><br>
<br>
I'm tired of being what you want me to be<br>
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface<br>
I don't know what you're expecting of me<br>
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes<br>
<span class="disabled">Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow</span><br>
Every step that I take is another mistake to you<br>
<span class="disabled">Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow</span><br>
<br>
I've become so numb, <span class="disabled">I can't feel you there</span><br>
Become so tired, <span class="disabled">so much more aware</span><br>
By becoming this <span class="disabled">all I want to do</span><br>
Is be more like me <span class="disabled">and be less like you</span><br>
<br>
Can't you see that you're smothering me<br>
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control<br>
'Cause everything that you thought I would be<br>
Has fallen apart right in front of you<br>
<span class="disabled">Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow</span><br>
Every step that I take is another mistake to you<br>
<span class="disabled">Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow</span><br>
And every second I waste is more than I can take!<br>
<br>
I've become so numb, <span class="disabled">I can't feel you there</span><br>
Become so tired, <span class="disabled">so much more aware</span><br>
By becoming this <span class="disabled">all I want to do</span><br>
Is be more like me <span class="disabled">and be less like you</span><br>
<br>
And I know I may end up failing too<br>
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you<br>
<br>
I've become so numb, <span class="disabled">I can't feel you there</span><br>
Become so tired, <span class="disabled">so much more aware</span><br>
By becoming this <span class="disabled">all I want to do</span><br>
Is be more like me <span class="disabled">and be less like you</span><br>
<br>
I've become so numb,<span class="disabled"> I can't feel you there</span><br>
I'm tired of being what you want me to be<br>
I've become so numb,<span class="disabled"> I can't feel you there</span><br>
I'm tired of being what you want me to be<br>
