<br>
I'm gonna fight 'em off<br>
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back<br>
They're gonna rip it off<br>
Taking their time right behind my back<br>
<br>
And I'm talkin' to myself at night<br>
Because I can't forget<br>
Back and forth through my mind<br>
Behind a cigarette<br>
<br>
And the message comin' from my eyes says<br>
Leave it alone<br>
<br>

<br>
Don't wanna hear about it<br>
Every single one's got a story to tell<br>
Everyone knows about it<br>
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell<br>
<br>
And if I catch it comin' back my way<br>
I'm gonna serve it to you<br>
And that ain't what you want to hear<br>
But that's what I'll do<br>
<br>
And the feeling coming from my bones says<br>
Find a home<br>

<br>
I'm going to Wichita<br>
Far from this opera for evermore<br>
I'm gonna work the straw<br>
Make the sweat drip out of every pore<br>
<br>
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding<br>
Right before the lord<br>
All the words are gonna bleed from me<br>
And I will think no more<br>
<br>
And the stains comin' from my blood tell me<br>
Go back home<br>
