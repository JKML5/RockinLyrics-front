Load up on guns and bring your friends<br>
It's fun to lose and to pretend<br>

Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello<br>
<br>
With the lights out, it's less dangerous<br>
Here we are now, entertain us<br>
I feel stupid and contagious<br>
Here we are now, entertain us<br>
A mulatto<br>
An albino<br>
A mosquito<br>
My libido<br>
Yay<br>
Yay<br>
