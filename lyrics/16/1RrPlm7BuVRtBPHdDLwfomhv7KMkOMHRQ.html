<span class="info">1.2.3.4</span> We all came out to Montreux<br>
On the Lake Geneva shoreline<br>
...To make records with a mobile<br>
.....We didn't have much time<br>
Frank Zappa and the Mothers<br>
Were at the best place around<br>
But some stupid with a flare gun<br>
Burned the place to the ground<br>
<br>
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky<br>

<span class="info">1.2.3.4</span> They burned down the gambling house<br>
It died with an awful sound<br>
a Funky Claude was running in and out<br>
....Pulling kids out the ground<br>
When it all was over<br>
We had to find another place<br>
But Swiss time was running out<br>
It seemed that we would lose the race<br>
