<span class="info">1.2.3.</span> I need to be myself<br>
I can't be no one else<br>
I'm feeling supersonic<br>
Give me gin and tonic<br>
..You can have it all but how much do you want it<br>
<br>
You make me laugh<br>
Give me your autograph<br>
Can I ride with you in your BMW<br>
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine<br>
<br>
<br>
You need to find out<br>
'Cos no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about<br>
<br>
You need to find a way for what you wanna say<br>
.....But before tomorrow<br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="info">1.2.3.4 </span>'Cos my friend said he'd take you home<br>
He sits in a corner all alone<br>
He lives under waterfall<br>
Nobody can see him<br>
Nobody can ever hear him call<br>
Nobody can ever hear him call<br>

I know a girl called Elsa<br>
She's into Alka Seltzer<br>
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train<br>
<br>
And she makes me laugh<br>
I got her autograph<br>
She done it with a doctor on a helicopter<br>
She's sniffin' in her tissue<br>
Sellin' the Big Issue<br>
<br>
When she finds out<br>
No one's gonna tell her what I'm on about<br>
You need to find a way for what you wanna say<br>
But before tomorrow<br>
