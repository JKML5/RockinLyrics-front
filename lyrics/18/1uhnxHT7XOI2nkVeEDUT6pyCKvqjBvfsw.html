I can't be no one else<br>

You make me laugh<br>

Can I ride with you in your BMW<br>
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine<br>

I know a girl called Elsa<br>
She's into Alka Seltzer<br>
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train<br>

She done it with a doctor on a helicopter<br>
She's sniffin' in her tissue<br>
Sellin' the Big Issue<br>
