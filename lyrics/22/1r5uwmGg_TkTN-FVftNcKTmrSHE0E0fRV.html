<span class="info">VERSE 1 @ 1.2.3.4</span> We met in June, for the first time<br>
We settled down in the stadium<br>
We’d never strummed together at that time<br>
No need to play rock’n’roll<br>
<br>
Rehearsals in a blazing sun<br>
A nice band of roasted chickens<br>
All united by a single goal<br>
To be there together and play rock’n’roll<br>
<br>
<span class="info">SHORT CHORUS @1.2.3.4</span> We are thousand, we are there<br>
We have proved that rock is not dead<br>
We’re together, to play loud<br>
Cause tonight we are rock’n’roll stars<br>
<br>
Oh yeah !
<br>
<br>
<span class="info">5 BARS OUTRO</span><br>
<span class="info">VERSE 2 @ 1.2.3.4</span> We can’t stop smiling like kids<br>
We could play all night long<br>
Ordinary amateur musicians<br>
But we filled the Stade de France<br>
<br>
Fifty thousand people watching us<br>
Fifty thousand souls sing in chorus<br>
Music makes us fly like a bird<br>
We are the biggest rock band in the world... Yeah !<br>
<br>
<span class="info">LONG CHORUS @ 1.2.3.4</span> We are thousand, we are there<br>

We’re together, we are proud<br>
To have thrilled this incredible crowd<br>

We are lawyers or pharmacists<br>
We are students, stay-at-home moms<br>
Or maybe just unemployed men<br>
<br>
You can't imagine<br>
The wealth behind the strangers<br>
That you meet on the streets<br>
Tonight you can see it... <span class="info">1.2.3.4 STOP</span><br>

We’re together, to play loud<br>
Cause tonight we are rock’n’roll stars<br>
