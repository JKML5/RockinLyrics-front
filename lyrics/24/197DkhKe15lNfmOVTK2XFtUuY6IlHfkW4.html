We'll be fighting in the streets<br>
With our children at our feet<br>
And the morals that they worship will be gone<br>
<br>
And the men who spurred us on<br>
Sit in judgement of all wrong<br>
They decide and the shotgun sings the song<br>
<br>
I'll tip my hat to the new constitution<br>
Take a bow for the new revolution<br>
Smile and grin at the change all around me<br>
Pick up my guitar and play<br>
Just like yesterday<br>
Then I'll get on my knees and pray<br>
<br>
We don't get fooled again<br>

<br>
I'll move myself and my family aside<br>
If we happen to be left half alive<br>
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky<br>
For I know that the hypnotized never lie<br>

YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!<br>
<br>
There's nothing in the street<br>
Looks any different to me<br>
And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye<br>
<br>
And the parting on the left<br>
Is now the parting on the right<br>
And the beards have all grown longer overnight<br>
<br>
I'll tip my hat to the new constitution<br>
Take a bow for the new revolution<br>
Smile and grin at the change all around me<br>
Pick up my guitar and play<br>
Just like yesterday<br>
Then I'll get on my knees and pray<br>
