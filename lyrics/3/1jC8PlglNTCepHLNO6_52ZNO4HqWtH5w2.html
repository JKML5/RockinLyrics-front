'Cause it's a bitter sweet.. symphony... this life<br>
Try to make ends meet<br>
You're a slave to.. money.. then you die<br>
I'll take you down the only ..road I've ever.. been down<br>
You know the one that takes you to the places<br>
where all ..the veins meet ..yeah<br>
<br>
No change, I can change<br>
I can change, I can change<br>
But I'm here in my mould<br>
I am here in my mould<br>
But I'm a million different people<br>
from one day to the next<br>
I can't change my mould<br>
No no......no.... No no<br>
<br>
<span class="disabled">Have you ever been down.....oh oooooooooooooo</span><br>
<br>
Well I’ve never prayed<br>
But tonight I'm on my.. knees yeah<br>
I need to hear some sounds that...<br>
recognize the pain in me... yeah<br>
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free.. now<br>
But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody<br>
singing to me.. now<br>
<br>
No change, I can change<br>
I can change, I can change<br>
But I'm here in my mould<br>
I am here in my mould<br>
And I'm a million different people<br>
from one day to the next....I can't change my mould<br>
No no......no.... No no<br>
<br>
<span class="disabled">Have you ever been down.....</span><br>
I can't change it you know<br>
I can't change it ................<span class="disabled">oh oooooooooooooo</span><br>
<br>
'Cause it's a bitter sweet... symphony this life<br>
Trying to make ends meet<br>
Trying to find some.. money then you die<br>
I'll take you down.. the only.. road I've ever been down<br>
You know the one that takes you to the places<br>
where all the veins meet yeah<br>
<br>
You know.. I can change, I can change<br>
I can change....I can change<br>
But I'm here in my mould<br>
I am here in my mould<br>
And I'm a million different people<br>
