They're forming in straight line<br>
They're going through a tight wind<br>
The kids are losing their minds<br>
The blitzkrieg bop<br>

They're piling in the back seat<br>
They're generating steam heat<br>
Pulsating to the back beat<br>
The blitzkrieg bop<br>
<br>
Hey ho, let's go<br>
Shoot'em in the back now<br>
What they want, I don't know<br>
They're all revved up and ready to go<br>
