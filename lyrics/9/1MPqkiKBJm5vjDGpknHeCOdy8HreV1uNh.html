I was born.. in a crossfire hurricane<br>
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain<br>
<br>
But it's all right now, in fact it's a gas<br>
But it's all right<br>
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas<br>

I was raised.. by a toothless, bearded hag<br>
I was schooled ..with a strap right across my back<br>
<br>
But it's all right now, in fact it's a gas<br>
But it's all right<br>
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas<br>

I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead<br>
I fell down, to my feet and I saw they bled<br>
...Yeah yeah and I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread<br>
Yeah yeah yeah I was crowned ..with a spike right<br>
through my head... right my head<br>
<br>
But it's all right now, in fact it's a gas<br>
But it's all right<br>
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas<br>
